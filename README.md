Employee data can be stored in this information system.
Data to be kept: name, number of years, address, and amount of income.
Also in this application I modeled this problem using java object system and realized persistence using MYSQL database.
It is possible to record, read changes, and delete employee data.
The application has the following functionalities:
display of all employees from the base,
modification of employee data based on ID,
deleting an employee based on an ID,
bringing in a new employee to the base.
